# ♻️ ReLoop – The Circular Exchange

### 🌍 Nothing wasted. Everything relooped.

**ReLoop** is a digital platform that transforms industrial and household waste into raw material opportunities.  
It connects **manufacturers, artisans, recyclers, and donors** who can buy, sell, or donate leftover materials like metals, plastics, wood, and fabric — giving waste a **second life** in small-scale production, 3D printing, or art projects.
